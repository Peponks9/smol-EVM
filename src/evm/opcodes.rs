//! EVM opcode definitions
//!
//! The EVM is a stack-based virtual machine that executes a bytecode program.
//! The bytecode program is a sequence of opcodes, which are executed in sequence.
//! The opcodes are defined in this module.
//!
//! The opcodes are defined in the Yellow Paper:
//! https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf
//!
//! The opcodes are defined in the EIPs:
//! https://eips.ethereum.org/
